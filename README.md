# EndoVis2021 - FetReg: Placental Vessel Segmentation and Registration in Fetoscopy Challenge

### Challenge website: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn25313156
### Contact: endovis-weiss-vision@ucl.ac.uk

FetReg2021 challenge is taking place within the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenges at the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI2021) which will be held from September 27th to October 1st 2021 as a virtual event. 

FetReg2021 focuses on providing improved visualization of the fetal environment by expanding the fetoscopic field of view.
With the FetReg challenge, we have introduced the first large scale multi-centric dataset of fetoscopy laser photocoagulation procedure, which contains 2060 pixel-wise annotated images from 18 different in vivo TTTS fetoscopic surgeries and 18 unannotated video clips video clips containing 7411 frames. 
FetReg invites the participants to solve the following tasks:
#### Task 1: [Placental semantic segmentation](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn25313156/wiki/610166)
#### Task 2: [Placental RGB frame registration for mosaicking](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn25313156/wiki/610166)


## EndoVis-FetReg2021 Repository

This repository contains docker dummy examples showing the path to set for the input and output folders and the format of the output masks/homography files. 

Follow the dummy docker examples to setup your docker images. All registered teams must submit these dockers via Syanpse using the following link:
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn25313156/wiki/609273

This repository also contains script for visualising the segmentation predicted masks and mosaics obtained from frame registration.
